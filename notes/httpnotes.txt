HTTP crash course------------------------------------>

so basic difference between http and https is that http is like sending
normal data which is normally readable but https is like sending data
in encrypted form which is normally not readable(in between)

how to transfer text--------->

URL , URI , URN (basically the location to do the communication)

headers------------->

metadata : key value pair send along with request and response(data about data)
what header do???
caching, authentication, manage state
x-prefix was used before 2012
types of headers???
->request headers -------> from client
->response headers ------> from server
->representation headers ------> encoding/confession
->payload headers -------> data

Most common headers-------->

Accept: application/json
User: which agent
Authorization : Bear_
Content - types
Cookie 
Cache control

=>>Cors headers and Security headers are also there

HTTP methods-------------->

GET : retrieve a resource
PUT : replace a resource
POST : interact with resource(mostly add resource)
HEAD : no message body (response headers only like for user agents and all)
OPTIONS : what operations are available
TRACE : loopback test (get same data for debug and all)
DELETE : remove a resource
PATCH : change part of a resource

HTTPS status code-------------->
1xx informational
2xx success
3xx redirection
4xx client error
5xx server error
